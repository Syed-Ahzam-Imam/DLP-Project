<h1>Face Mask Detection Project</h1>

This project implements a face mask detection model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images as containing a person with a mask or without a mask.

**Introduction**

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the virus. Automatic face mask detection can be a valuable tool in public places to ensure adherence to safety guidelines. This project develops a deep learning model to achieve this task.

**Methodology**

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The methodology involves the following steps:

**Data Collection:** A dataset of images containing people with and without masks is collected.

**Data Preprocessing:** Images are resized to a uniform size, converted to the appropriate color format (e.g., RGB), and pixel values are normalized.

**Data Augmentation:** The dataset is augmented to increase its size and improve the model's ability to generalize. Techniques like image flipping, rotation, zooming, and shifting can be used.

**Training the Model:** The preprocessed and augmented dataset is used to train the CNN model. The model learns to identify features that distinguish between masked and unmasked faces.

**Model Evaluation:** The performance of the trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.

**Model Monitoring:** The model's performance is continuously monitored in real-world deployment. Retraining or updating the model might be necessary to maintain effectiveness over time.


**Code Description**

The provided code demonstrates the following steps:

**Import Libraries**: Necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy are imported for deep learning, image processing, and numerical computations.

**Load Dataset:** The Kaggle API is used to download a pre-existing face mask dataset. The dataset is extracted and the paths to images with and without masks are identified.

**Create Labels:** Labels (1 for masked, 0 for unmasked) are assigned to each image based on its category.

**Image Processing:** Images are loaded, converted to NumPy arrays, and resized to a fixed size.

**Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

**Data Scaling:** Pixel values are normalized between 0 and 1 for better training efficiency.

**Build CNN Model:** A sequential CNN model is created using Keras. The model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

**Compile Model:** The model is compiled by specifying the optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., sparse_categorical_crossentropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy) used during training.

**Train Model:** The model is trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs. This involves iteratively feeding data batches, updating model weights, and minimizing the loss function.

**Evaluate Model:** The trained model is evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance in classifying masked and unmasked faces.
