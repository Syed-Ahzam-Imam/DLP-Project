    <h1>Currency Detection Model</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for a currency detection model built using TensorFlow and CNNs. The model aims to identify different currencies from input images accurately.</p>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Currency detection is an essential task in various applications such as automated teller machines (ATMs), vending machines, and currency exchange systems. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying different currencies from images.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>To run the currency detection model, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repository:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Syed-Ahzam-Imam/DLP-Project.git</code></pre>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>Install dependencies:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>After installation, you can use the model by following these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your input images containing currency notes.</li>
        <li>Run the detection script:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>python testAPI.py</code></pre>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>The model will output the detected currency along with its confidence score.</li>
    </ol>
