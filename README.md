 <h1>Face Mask Detection Project</h1>
  <p>This project implements a face mask detection model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images as containing a person with a mask or without a mask.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the virus. Automatic face mask detection can be a valuable tool in public places to ensure adherence to safety guidelines. This project develops a deep learning model to achieve this task.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The methodology involves the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> A dataset of images containing people with and without masks is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Images are resized to a uniform size, converted to the appropriate color format (e.g., RGB), and pixel values are normalized.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Augmentation:</strong> The dataset is augmented to increase its size and improve the model's ability to generalize. Techniques like image flipping, rotation, zooming, and shifting can be used.</li>
    <li><strong>Training the Model:</strong> The preprocessed and augmented dataset is used to train the CNN model. The model learns to identify features that distinguish between masked and unmasked faces.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The performance of the trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> The model's performance is continuously monitored in real-world deployment. Retraining or updating the model might be necessary to maintain effectiveness over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Description</h2>
  <p>The provided code demonstrates the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Import Libraries:</strong> Necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy are imported for deep learning, image processing, and numerical computations.</li>
    <li><strong>Load Dataset:</strong> The Kaggle API is used to download a pre-existing face mask dataset. The dataset is extracted and the paths to images with and without masks are identified.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Labels:</strong> Labels (1 for masked, 0 for unmasked) are assigned to each image based on its category.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Images are loaded, converted to NumPy arrays, and resized to a fixed size.</li>
    <li><strong>Train-Test Split:</strong> The data is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Scaling:</strong> Pixel values are normalized between 0 and 1 for better training efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Build CNN Model:</strong> A sequential CNN model is created using Keras. The model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.</li>
    <li><strong>Compile Model:</strong> The model is compiled by specifying the optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., sparse_categorical_crossentropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy) used during training.</li>
    <li><strong>Train Model:</strong> The model is trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs. This involves iteratively feeding data batches, updating model weights, and minimizing the loss function.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate Model:</strong> The trained model is evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance in classifying masked and unmasked faces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Train the model for a longer duration or with a more extensive dataset to potentially improve accuracy.</li>
    <li>Explore different CNN architectures or hyperparameter tuning for potential performance gains.</li>
    <li>Implement the model for real-time face mask detection using a webcam or video stream.</li>
  </ul>
